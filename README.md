Database Course - Assignment - Simple Database Management System Simulator Using Python 

Simply it's a CRUD system, acting like a database table, if you open the .txt file included you'll see the data inside is taking a shape of a table, still in progress of making it able to remove the entire table, also trying to make it able to add different tables to the same file, fingers crossed.

feel free to make whatever you want with the project, maybe you'll be able to help me make it better.

Thanks!
